                to know how I think. You may not agree with some of the things mentioned, that is fine. You may of read
                the
                first sentence and left by now, that is also fine. The purpose of this webpage is not to preach my
                opinions
                but to share my experience (I am not a scientist, I am a common thinker like you). Life is not a problem
                to
                be solved, it is a reality to be experienced. </p>

            <h2 id="why-tech">Why Tech?</h2>
            <p>I started learning web development approximately 5 months ago and have created a strong passion for this
                work. The combination of creativity and problem-solving skills inherent in web development fuels my
                drive
                for success in this field. I have always been a creative mind when it comes to the arts; I have made
                everything from visuals for music videos to clay sculptures and more. The creative energy within me is
                tapped with a problem solving yet organizational tone when participating in this field of study. It
                makes me
                yearn for more! Which is why this field is the best because there is always something new to explore on
                the
                never ending quest of tech!
            </p>

        <h2 id="pillars">Pillars of my life</h2>
        <p>Balance is everything, the entire world of nature itself is sustained on maintaining the balance. A simple
            example is an ecosystem where there is wolves and deer within it. Too many wolves will result in the deer
            population being killed off and in turn will decrease the wolf population due to their food source becoming
            slim. Nature teeters back and forth to maintain the balance and the same can be said about your life.
            Although it may not be about murdering deer, you must understand that in order to find balance you must have
            imbalance first. </p>
        <h3 id="goal-setting">Goal Setting</h3>
        <p>Robert Sapolsky once wrote “Dopamine is not about the pursuit of happiness, it’s about the happiness of
            pursuit”. Robert is a neuroendocrinologist who has focused a lot of research on issues of stress and
            neurodegeneration, which is something that makes sense to go hand and hand. When I think about this quote, I
            think of my first pillar of life, which is goal setting. This could be the most important one in the grand
            scheme of things because if you have nothing to aim at, the parameters for success and failure don’t exist.
            It can be as simple as going to the gym at least twice in the coming week. When you have gone once, you
            realize you are moving toward your goal and it feels good because a parameter for success has been reached.
        </p>
        <p>The important part of goal setting is to remember that it’s not about fulfilling the end goal but rather
            how good it feels to work toward it. In my life, reaching the end of the journey usually does not feel as
            good as when you were on your way to it. Think of it as a song and you are a musician, the main task is to
            complete the song in its entirety as perfectly as you can. But the best songs are not the fastest ones and
            sometimes not even the most perfect. It’s all about the rises and falls, slowing sometimes but speeding up
            when needed to make a beautiful story. The point I’m trying to make here is the choices you make every day
            in pursuit of something will ultimately affect the quality or speed at which you reach it. Both quality and
            speed are a balance needed to be taken into account as well.</p>
        <h3 id="finding-comfort">Finding Comfort During Discomfort</h3>
        <p>There is always something I have found intriguing about putting myself through a struggle and overcoming
            it. It started in football as a young kid and after 17 years of playing, I look back now and see that it is
            where my love for it began. I took it to a new level when I moved back home to live with my friend Quinn
            after living in Bozeman, Montana for 3 years after college. Quinn embodied the warrior spirit of never
            giving up, even when the odds weren’t in his favor. As an ultra-marathon runner, he has put in thousands of
            miles on the trails and recruited myself and a friend to run the Spartan Beast 21k in Killington, VT with
            him. It was the hardest physical feat I have ever participated in but I learned a lot about myself during
            and leading up to the event. </p>
        <p> What I’ve learned from Quinn and others on my journey of life is that within every struggle lies on
            opportunity. This is a cliche that everyone is well aware of but I’d like you to really think about this for
            a second. This opportunity is one that will compound over time as you keep accomplishing tasks that suck, it
            makes you invincible. Better yet the opportunity is an invite to becoming indestructible both mentally and
            physically because you develop the mindset of “if I just completed that, I can complete this next thing”.
            This compounding of mental and physical feats is one that requires specific goal setting and making choices
            throughout your day that foster a healthier lifestyle that you can be proud of. You feel better about
            yourself when you are proud of who you are and the choices you make to find your own balance. It has taken
            years of looking within myself to get to where I am, looking within is a struggle in it of itself. You see
            patterns of behavior you do not like but recognizing these patterns is where it all starts. I urge you to
            look within and do something that is going to be hard because the benefits of working your way through a
            struggle are unparalleled to any other type of growth in my experience. </p>
        <h3 id="music">Music</h3>
        <p>At the bottom of my web page I mention how music is the lifeblood that tells the story of human existence,
            I use music as my avenue to understand the world. Your entire life is a musical composition made by you that
            tells the emotional story of your soul. And like all works of music, there is always an end. That is why it
            is so pivotal to live in the moment. Although this is easier said than done, it is something I believe
            everyone should strive for within their life. Music has allowed me to be more present in life, whether it be
            playing my guitar or listening to my favorite songs, it never fails to bring me back to where my feet are.
        </p>
        <p>Emotion is energy in motion and music is a perfect place for people to channel that energy because it
            brings people together. I’ve been to hundreds of musical concerts and I have seen people from all walks of
            life coming to see the shows I have been at. The bands you like most are usually the ones you connect with
            the most internally, it shows you aren’t alone in this twisted world. Being around people could be just as
            important to me as music because life gets a little less colorful when you’re completely alone, even if it’s
            by choice. Being among family or friends is becoming more important to me as I get older. It’s a delicate
            balance that needs to be cared for on a daily basis. You never realize how hard life is after high school
            but it makes it a little easier having a deeper connection to my loved ones around me. </p>
        <h3>If you’ve made it this far, I just want to thank you for taking the time to read more about me, it means
            more than you know. What is important to understand about everything I have wrote about is that it’s subject
            to change. These are all the things that I keep me balanced in my life currently but life isn’t a stagnant
            rock, it is a musical composition. Feel free to send me an email if you’d like to talk more about anything I
            have mentioned or just want to connect!</h3>
